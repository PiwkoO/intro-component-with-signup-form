## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- OOCSS methodology

### What I learned

In this challenge I wanted to check out different methodology than I usually use. I went with OOCSS because it's popular like BEM and refers to object-oriented principles (kind of). I definitely cannot say that I mastered it in any way, or I'm good, but it's always good to get new knowledge and different ways of writing code than usually.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to get better understanding in different methodologies and ways of working to be more familiar with it when I joined a company or team that utilize it.

### Useful resources

- [OOCSS methodology](https://medium.com/simuratli/what-is-oocss-object-oriented-css-c8667fd65dfe) - I referred to this article to get better understanding of OOCSS methodology.
